- That great discussion I had with a friend, we talked about work and other stuff. I feel so grateful to have him. I think I can talk to him about anything and enjoy the outcome.
- That moment when Tom came home and I was hiding behind the front door while opening it. Hearing him laugh made my day.
- Today was a productive day, unsure if Thanksgiving has anything to do with this but I enjoyed this day.
- One more house we found, still not the one but having more opportunities bring me joy.
