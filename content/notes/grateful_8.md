- I am so grateful to be in South Lake Tahoe this week to see my colleagues. Even if the flight was long and I am really tired.
- I am so happy to be able to FaceTime Clo√© and Tom everyday and having kind words and support from them.
- I wandered around this morning and had a really good time even if elevation was super intense in the morning.
