- Tom is sleeping at school tonight and seeing St Nicolas tomorrow morning, I am grateful the school he is in is doing this kind of activity.
- I got some packages coming in from the US. Even with import duties on them, I am grateful I found finally things I wanted.
- I have meditated for the last 56 days.
- I found a dentist practicing hypnosis to fight my inner fear of dentists.
