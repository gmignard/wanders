- My wife was really surprised by my birthday gift. This is something I almost never achieve. This was fun to see.
- We have a puppy at home, not ours but it is entertaining and preparing us for our own small beast.
- My cappuccino practice continues, I get better at it. It feels good.
- Had great people suggesting me beans. Be prepared for more good espresso and filter beans!
- I meditated for the last 45 days and feel good about it. Mostly late but I enjoy a few morning practices. I should make it the default, it feels better for the day.
