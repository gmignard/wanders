- I received an [amazing magazine](http://anotherescape.com) and the content is just delightful. It is about wilderness! ðŸŒ²
- I am eating sauerkraut today and it is one of my favorite meal on earth. I love winter just for that.
- We painted the living room and decluttered the room. It looks way better and I feel better into it.
- Tom can whistle now, or kind of.
