- My sister slept at home and painted with Tom. She is his godmother and it is really amazing to see them interact
- Tom had a school spectacle. He was singing christmas songs. This was a really fun and sweet moment. He was wearing Santa's hat.
- Today, Cloe's parents are coming to our place for Christmas. It will be fun times with the whole family, I cannot wait.
- I love this period of the year when I can listen to Christmas songs without any shame. I cannot wait to listen to more She & Him ðŸ˜„
- I realized I was falling behind on the excercising. Cloe had an amazing reaction "Don't feel bad, just act" and it seems like it is something I can apply in many parts of my decisions.
